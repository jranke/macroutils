    R package: macroutils

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.1
    
    2015/03/17  Moved from a local SVN to a public git (GitHub) 
        repository. Last SVN version was 18:52M (macroutils 1.8.0)
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.0
    
    2015/03/17  From now on macroutils will contain only "official" 
        MACRO routines and utilities, and the routines related 
        to crop growth (under development) have been moved to 
        another R package, macrocrop (not publicly released).
        
        macroutils was split for SVN version "18:50M" (macroutils 
        version 1.7.4).
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.4
    
    2014/12/08  Bug fix in macroLAI()
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.3

    2014/09/28  Compiled for R 3.1.1
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.2

    2014/07/03  Added the function macroutilsInfo() that fetches 
        and return a rather comprehensive report on system info 
        and package(s) version(s) and MD5, either for macroutils 
        or for any other package
        
        SVN revision is now displayed when the package is attached
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.1
    
    2014/05/28 to 2014/06/03    Attempts to improve the LAI-calculations 
        for multiple crops. Did not work in some cases.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.0
    
    2014/05/26  Now macroLAI() can handle a data.frame of 
        crop parameters (multiple crops).
        
        Parameter "Date" in macroLAI() renamed 'x'
        
        macroIntercept() parameters now simplified
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6.2
    
    2014/05/22  fixed a bug in macroLAI() and macroRootDepth() 
        and macroRootDensity(): parameters iharv and laiharv renamed 
        iharv and laihar (now correct)
        
        bug fix: macroPlot() was not always identifying correctly 
            when given a list of data.frame to plot
        
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6.1
    
    2014/05/22  macroPlot() now includes a parameter 'z' for 
        pre-selecting the variables to include in the graph
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6.0

    2014/05/15  Included macroLAI() and macroIntercept() to calculate 
        total and green LAI a-la-MACRO and the fraction of irrigation 
        water intercepted by the crop vegetation.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.0

    2014/05/12  Included macroRootDepth() and macroRootDensity(), 
        functions to estimate root depth and density as in 
        MACRO

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.0
    
    2014/05/12  Included a bug-fix for MACRO GUI parameter database, 
        macroBugFixCleanDb(), that remove orphan and duplicated 
        values in the table `Output()`. Might be deleted when 
        the bug has been fixed in MACRO GUI.
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.0
    
    2014/03/19
        
        macroReadBin() now output macroTimeSeries or 
        macroTimeSeriesList objects (class), instead of 
        macroData and macroDataList
        
        Some functions made S3 generic and S3 methods, to favour 
        future extensions.
        
        macroPlot() created, generic and method function to plot 
        macroTimeSeries and macroTimeSeriesList, as well 
        as bin files (with GUI). Superseeds macroPlotBin() 
        
        A bug was fixed in macroPlot() background grid, which 
        were not displayed at the right place on the X-axis, 
        because of the POSIXct time format (incompatible with 
        grid()).
        
        macroPlot() now uses a ggplot2-style for axes, grid and 
        background color.
        
        macroPlot() now uses hcl() to generate default variable 
        colors (it looks nicer)

              SMU.plot() now has a "menu" to change the 
              variables plotted, the plot style, or to 
              zoom in and out.
              
              The file chooser in the GUI now remembers

              SMU.plot() have been changed heavily, and 
              does not rely any more on 'ggplot2'.

              (hidden)
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.4 

    2012/05/10 Added SMU.stripRunID to remove Run ID from MACRO

    2010/09/08 Version 1.0 of the package. Documented.

              SMU.writeBin so weather files without header
